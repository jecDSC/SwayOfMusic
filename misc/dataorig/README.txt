Body sway when standing and listening to music modified to reinforce virtual reality environment motion

Twenty-eight subjects (13 male; 18 female) between the ages of 18 and 35 stood still for 60s while wearing an Occulus Rift virtual reality (VR) head mounted display.
While standing they were exposed to the following sensory conditions.

ECL1.csv - They stood with their eyes closed while listening to Mozart's Jupiter as its loudness shifted at 0.1Hz

ECL2.csv - They stood with their eyes closed while listening to Mozart's Jupiter as its loudness shifted at 0.25Hz.

ECR.csv - They stood with their eyes closed looking at the VR environment while listening to an unmodified version Mozart's Jupiter.

ECN.csv - They stood with their eyes closed looking at the VR environment while listening to no music.

WL1.csv - They stood with their eyes open looking at the VR environment translating in the anterior posterior direction at 0.1 Hz while listening to 
Mozart's Jupiter as its loudness shifted at 0.1 Hz.

WL2.csv - They stood with their eyes open looking at the VR environment translating in the anterior posterior direction at 0.1 Hz while listening to 
Mozart's Jupiter as its loudness shifted at 0.25 Hz.

WN.csv - They stood with their eyes open looking at the VR environment translating in the anterior posterior direction at 0.1 Hz while listening to no
music.

WR.csv - They stood with their eyes open looking at the VR environment translating in the anterior posterior direction at 0.1 Hz while listening to an 
unmodified version Mozart's Jupiter.

WOL1.csv -They stood with their eyes open looking at the VR environment while listening to Mozart's Jupiter as its loudness shifted at 0.1 Hz.

WOL2.csv - They stood with their eyes open looking at the VR environment while listening to Mozart's Jupiter as its loudness shifted at 0.25 Hz.

WON.csv - They stood with their eyes open looking at the VR environment while listening to no music.

WOR.csv - They stood with their eyes open looking at the VR environment while listening to an unmodified version Mozart's Jupiter.


Time (Time), vertical force (Fz), moment about the medial lateral axis (Mx), moment about the anterior posterior axis (My), medial lateral center of pressure
location (COPx), and anterior-posterior center of pressure location (COPy) data were all collected at 1000 Hz from a balance plate (Bertec Corp., Columbus, OH)
