      1. We have done a few things, mainly pertaining to cleaning the dataset.
      For instance, the dataset we picked, which contained the swaying data from
      participants under different conditions, was too big to push onto github,
      so we removed many of the participants since the dataset was too large.
      Additionally, the rows were all 1000th of a second, so we condensed the
      data to also clean and shorten the data. For the visualizations, we have
      decided to come up with one main visualization and a few supporting to
      showcase the data and the overall message of our visualization. Our
      visualization shows how a participant moves in their body in the VR
      environment

      The most challenging part of the project will be coming up with a cohesive
      design for the website to showcase our narrative. We want to showcase the
      sway of people to show the effect of music and environment on the sway of
      participants, but currently we are not too sure on how to effectively
      communicate this idea. Additionally, trying to come up with multiple
      interactive visualizations to fully showcase the data of people swaying is
      another challenge, since we are limited to showing the swaying data, which
      only has data on people swaying and nothing more, so it is hard to come up
      with additional visualizations for this data. Finally, the most difficult
      challenge is the main visualization, and making sure it is interactive and
      presentable and professional is the biggest challenge.
